Here are just a few of the many excellent term projects submitted to my
ECS 132 classes.

To understand the real quality, you must read the text portions.  Many
have very nice graphics, and that IS part of the reason I selected
them, but the main reason is the ANALYSIS.  And to understand that, you
need to actually read the prose.

Disclaimer:  The fact that I've chosen these projects as exemplars does
not imply that every aspect in an exemplar project was good.  In some
cases one aspect was weak, but the other aspects were so strong that it
was I was compelled to choose them as exemplars.
